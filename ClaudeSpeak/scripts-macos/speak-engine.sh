# ClaudeSpeak speaker (macOS). Speaks a text file through the configured route.
#
# Routes:
#   voiceover  - hands the text to VoiceOver, so it uses the user's own voice,
#                rate and punctuation level, and their usual silence key stops it.
#                Requires "Allow VoiceOver to be controlled with AppleScript"
#                (VoiceOver Utility > General).
#   say        - a separate system voice, independent of any screen reader.
#   auto       - voiceover if VoiceOver is running, else say.
#
# Never throws: a speech failure must not break the session.
